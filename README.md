This is an experiment with creating a WordPress Development Environment.

## Usage

Run `npm start` to check it out.

## Notes

Holding down Cmd+Shift while clicking the icon will open Dev Tools.

This currently only runs on MacOS, but is intended to run on all platforms. PRs are accepted for cross platform compatibility.

Currently, you need to restart if you change your WordPress folder. This shortcoming will hopefully be fixed in the not-too-distant future (#7).
