This is an experiment with creating a WordPress Development Environment.

## Usage

Run `npm install`, then `npm run dev` to check it out.

## Notes

Holding down Cmd+Shift while clicking the icon will open Dev Tools.

This is currently tested on MacOS and Windows, but it should probably run on Linux, too. Bug reports and PRs are greatly appreciated. ðŸ™‚

You'll need to [install Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download) manually before running WPDE.
